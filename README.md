 # Summary 
This article discusses the declining trend in employment rates for software developers in the U.S. Since 2018, the number of developers has decreased despite their demand surge at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Software developers pay growth has increased over the years, but its growth has lagged behind compared to overall U.S workers. The website also talks about regional pay disparities, like the highest pay being in Silicon Valley, as well as pay growth in areas like Salt Lake City and Orlando.

I have also seen similar trends on the news and in other articles. It seems scary that the big tech companies are firing many software engineers and worries me about my future employment. However, from the numbers provided by professor Bloomberg, the employment opportunities are still on the rise and I think we should be hopeful and oppotunisitic about it!
